Here's the plan:

* Create simple command line app to create and manipulate a to do list
* Learn a little more about C#
* Refactor the command line app
* Learn about hooking into a DB (pg?)
* Refactor the app to hook into said DB
* Add items to this list
* Refactor the app
* Repeat the previous two steps ad nauseam
